      "4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH\n",
      "Mr Shariff died on 10 May 2016 at Fairfield General Hospital having been admitted following a\n",
      "cardiac arrest at his home address that day. He had had an unwitnessed fallen from a chair onto\n",
      "his kitchen floor on 8 May and attended at the Urgent Care Centre promptly following that fall.\n",
      "Neither a CT scan nor additional neurological observations were undertaken during that\n",
      "consultation. Mr Shariff attended the Urgent Care Centre again on 9 May with a history of head\n",
      "pain and recent vomiting. No CT scan was undertaken notwithstanding those symptoms and Mr\n",
      "Shariff was discharged home. On 10 May Mr Shariff was taken to hospital by attending paramedics\n",
      "where the presence of an intracerebral haemorrhage was confirmed. Mr Shariff was undergoing\n",
      "haemodialysis, which placed him at increased risk of haemorrhage. This was not appreciated by\n",
      "attending clinicians due to this not being referred to within the NICE guidelines for head injuries.\n",

      "commonly known within the medical profession or referred to in the relevant NICE guidelines. This\n",
      "lack of awareness could create a risk that other deaths will continue to exist or occur in the future\n",
      "and whilst I am satisfied that the Trust have taken this matter very seriously, in that they have\n",
      "implemented appropriate measures to reduce the risk of this occurring in the future, I am\n",
      "concerned with the National picture as I am mindful that it may take some time for the significance\n",
      "of a head injury within patients with undergoing haemodialysis or with significant uremia due to\n",
      "renal failure to be incorporated into the NICE guidelines.\n",
      "6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN\n",

      "this particular highway, the Council has concluded that any works at this site such as\n",
      "crash barriers or Cornish hedging are as likely to cause injury to occupants of any\n",
      "vehicle that fails to negotiate the bends as to protect them from it. We note that in\n",
      "this instance the head injuries to Mr Siddall resulted partly from his failure to wear a\n",

      "relatively minor and Mr Siddall‚Äôs vehicle continued to drive over the field largely\n",
      "undamaged until it came to rest at the stream. Had a solid barrier been at the foot of\n",

      "years at this location (a minor injury collision). Given the severity of this bend at the\n",

      "injury rate. The lack of injury may well be attributable to the comparatively benign\n",
